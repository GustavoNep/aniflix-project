In this project I used the three react hooks useState,useEffect,useContext.

## About

The project consisted of being a Netflix consuming data from a rest API about Anime.
The api in question used was Jikan API.

## Firebase

A Firebase database was used for the backend where I could store user data as well as their favorite Anime.

## Tailwind CSS

For the style, several functionalities that tailwind provides were used, making the code much cleaner and more functional to work with.

  Now You can enjoy the Aniflix and have your favorites animes from the season organized :)
